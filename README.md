# Qr_code
Project Descripton 
In my pursuit of improving my coding skills, I have accepted this challenge.
The goal of this challenge is to design an interactive QR Code using diverse coding tools.
I used my knowledge of basics of HTML and CSS to design it. The Code was design into two distinct views, the first one is for Desktop viewers, while the Second one is for Mobile viewers. I gave everyone chance to view it.
